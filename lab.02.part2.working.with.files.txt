11. First: MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE mtec1003-lab-02 directory!
***If you accidentally delete your other files, you'll have to start over!!***

Force the removal of the directory and its files using the -rf flag

Use this command:

$ rm -rf my_files
(options r = recursive; f = skip confirmation)

rm -rf my_files
Lorenas-MBP-2:lab02 lorenagaleano$




==========
12. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1003-lab-02 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command called cat on the file to show its contents.

Describe what happened below.
----------
cd books/other
cat pg1232.txt

Terminal opened the file called pg 1232.txt inside Terminal




==========
13. That was a lot of text.  Let's find ways to limit it.  Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------
head pg1232.txt
Title: The Prince




==========
14. Using the same file again!

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use tail on the file to show the contents of the end of the file.

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below.
----------
tail pg1232.txt


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

    http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.


==========
15. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------
less pg1232.txt
(LESS shows you less of the Terminal and uses search word to look through the text)
(spacebar shows you the top portion of the text. )
(q lets you exit out of this viewing )




==========
16. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------
Less and more when yourlooking for a specifc term to read about in a text you can use Less and more to navigate with in the file by using serch words.
cat is a faster way to opens files in Terminal
if you want to navigate to the bottom of the text.
and if you were looking for the title you could use head





==========
17.  How many words are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the word count?
----------

wc pg1232.txt
    5063   52639  305864 pg1232.txt





==========
18.  How many lines are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the line count?
----------


wc -l pg1232.txt
    5063 pg1232.txt



==========
19.  Make sure you're in the books/other folder.  Copy all of the txt files from that folder to your home directory using wildcard matching.

Write the command that you used below.
----------

cp -r pg1232.txt /icloud drive/desktop/mtech1003/
usage: cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvXc] source_file target_file
      cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvXc] source_file ... target_directory



==========
Next: Save this file. Then, using your mouse or a Terminal command that you learned this week, MOVE this file into your "mtec1003-lab-02" folder.

And that's it! Now, go on to LAB 2 / PART 3...
